        # Da Vinci PDex Payer Server Test Suite

        This suite validates that a payer system can act as a
        data source for client systems to connect to and retrieve
        data from. This includes provider systems as well as other
        payer systems using the payer to payer data retrieval approach.
        Inferno will act as a client system connecting to the system
        under test and making requests for data against it.
